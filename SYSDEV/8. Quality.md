-   **Usability**: This refers to the ease with which the software can be used by the user.
-   **Efficiency**: This refers to the resources (e.g., time, memory, etc.) that the software consumes while performing its intended functions.
-   **Maintainability**: This refers to the ease with which the software can be modified or updated to fix bugs or add new features.
-   **Testability**: This refers to the ease with which the software can be tested to ensure that it meets the required quality standards.
