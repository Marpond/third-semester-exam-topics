The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It is based on the idea of using small, focused periods of time (called "Pomodoros") to complete tasks, separated by short breaks. The goal of the Pomodoro Technique is to improve productivity and reduce the negative effects of multitasking and interruptions.

To use the Pomodoro Technique, you can follow these steps:

1.  Choose a task that you want to work on.
2.  Set a timer for 25 minutes (the length of a Pomodoro).
3.  Work on the task until the timer goes off.
4.  Take a short break (usually 5 minutes).
5.  Repeat the process for a total of four Pomodoros, and then take a longer break (usually 15-30 minutes).

The Pomodoro Technique can be an effective way to improve focus and productivity, as it helps to break up work into smaller, more manageable chunks. It can also help to reduce the negative effects of multitasking and interruptions by encouraging you to focus on one task at a time.
