Atern, also known as the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), is a framework for Agile software development. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for rapid delivery of high-quality software.

## Big Picture

Atern is based on the Agile principles of collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery. It is focused on delivering value to the customer through iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing and cross-functional teams.

## Pros and Cons

One of the main advantages of Atern is that it allows for rapid delivery of working software, which can be beneficial in situations where there is a pressing need for a solution. It also emphasizes collaboration and customer involvement, which can lead to better alignment with business needs.

However, Atern may not be suitable for all projects, as it requires a high level of discipline and commitment from all team members. It may also be difficult to implement in organizations that are not accustomed to Agile methods.

## Project Management

In Atern, project management focuses on delivering working software through a series of time-boxed iterations called "timeboxes." Each timebox has a specific goal and deliverable, and the team works together to meet these goals within the allotted time.

## Comparison with Other Methods

Atern is similar to other Agile methods, such as Scrum and Lean, in that it emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and the rapid delivery of working software. However, it differs in that it has a more prescriptive and structured approach, with a specific set of roles and responsibilities, and a focus on defining and prioritizing requirements up front.
