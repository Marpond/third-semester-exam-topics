[DSDM and AgilePM â€“ DSDM Workshop with Keith Richards, Lead Author of DSDM Atern - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOIAhrlkgak&t)

Atern, also known as the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), is a framework for Agile software development. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for rapid delivery of high-quality software.

## Big Picture

##### 1. Principles
1. Focus on the business need
2. Deliver on time
3. Collaborate
4. Never compromise quality
5. Build incrementally from firm foundations
6. Develop iteratively
7. Communicate continuously and clearly
8. Demonstrate control
 
##### 2. Lifecycle
![[Pasted image 20230107145701.png]]
This is not a flowchart, we flick between exploration and engineering quite a lot.

In the Feasibility phase of the atern project life cycle, the viability and outline business case for the project are assessed. This phase involves evaluating the technical feasibility and potential for success of the project, as well as identifying any obstacles and developing strategies to overcome them.

In the Foundations phase, the project is understood and defined at a high level, and technology components and standards are agreed upon. This is a key phase for ensuring that the scope of the project can be baselined and the development activity can begin.

In the Exploration phase of the atern project life cycle, the primary goal is to unleash the creativity of the team to come up with as many potential solutions as possible. This phase involves expanding on high level requirements to demonstrate the functionality of the solution.

In the Engineering phase, the solution is iteratively developed and made ready for release.

##### 3. Products
Total of 17 products.

Deliverables (products) are associated with different phases of a project's lifecycle and may vary in formality depending on the project and organization, with some products being specific to certain phases and others evolving through subsequent phases. The Atern methodology allows for flexibility in how products are created and tailored to different environments, with some environments requiring all products and others only requiring specific ones.

##### 4. Roles
![[Pasted image 20230106153221.png]]

###### Project-level
Collectively, these roles are responsible for the successful delivery of the software project, including the management of budget, schedule, resources, and quality.

1.  Business sponsor: Provides strategic direction and funding for the project.
2.  Business visionary: Holds the customer and supplier visions of solution excellence and communicates them to the team.
3.  Technical co-ordinator: Coordinates technical aspects of the project, including the development and implementation of technical solutions.
4.  Project manager: Ensures that the funding for the project is used effectively to create the envisaged solution, and is responsible for the overall management and successful delivery of the project.

###### Solution development

1.  Team leader: Leads the team responsible for developing the solution and ensures that the team is working effectively towards the project goals.
2.  Business ambassador: Represents the business and helps make sure that the solution being developed meets the needs of the business. They also help test and document the solution and make sure that users know how to use it.
3.  Business analyst: Helps make sure that the business's needs are understood and that the technical team has the information they need to build a solution that meets those needs.
4.  Solution developer: Designs and builds the technical components of the solution.
5.  Solution tester: Tests the solution to ensure that it meets the required specifications and is fit for purpose.

###### Supporting

1.  Technical advisor: Provides technical expertise and guidance to the project team as needed.
2.  Business advisor: Provides business-related advice and guidance to the project team.
3.  Workshop facilitator: Leads and facilitates workshops related to the project.
4.  DSDM coach: Provides guidance and coaching on the DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) framework and methodology.


##### 5. Key techniques
1. Facilitated workshops
2. Modelling
3. MoSCoW (on time, protect quality)
4. Iterative development (prototyping)
	- Extremely powerful way of communication, not just proof of concept
	- Reduces need for documentation
5. Timeboxing

## Pros and Cons

## Project Management

In Atern, project management focuses on delivering working software through a series of time-boxed iterations called "timeboxes." Each timebox has a specific goal and deliverable, and the team works together to meet these goals within the allotted time.
