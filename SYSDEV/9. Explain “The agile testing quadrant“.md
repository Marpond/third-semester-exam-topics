 [Quick introduction to Agile testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRsa-tJNsrY)

The Agile Testing Quadrant is a model for understanding the different types of testing that are typically performed during the software development process. The quadrant numbering system does NOT imply any order. You don’t work through the quadrants from 1 to 4, in a waterfall style. It’s just an arbitrary numbering.

Q1 and Q2 are preventive tests, Q3 and Q4 are detective tests.

- Q1 Story/task level testing
	- Continuous feedback to the developers
	- Improves the design
- Q2 Feature level testing
- Q3 System level testing
- Q4 Non-funcitonal testing

1.  Technology-facing tests: These are tests that focus on the underlying technology of the product, such as the infrastructure, databases, and technical integrations.

2.  Business-facing tests: These are tests that focus on the business aspects of the product, such as the user experience, usability, and overall value to the customer.

3.  Tests that support the team: These are tests that help the development team ensure that their code is working correctly and meet the project's technical requirements.

4.  Tests that critique the product: These are tests that evaluate the overall quality of the product and provide feedback to the development team on how to improve it.

Functional tests are tests that verify that the functions of a software application are working correctly. They are designed to test the application's functionality from the user's perspective, ensuring that the user can perform all the necessary tasks and that the application behaves as expected.

Alpha testing is typically the first stage of testing in which the product is tested by a small group of internal or external testers. This testing is done in a controlled environment, such as the development team's office or a test lab, and is often used to identify any major issues with the product before it is released to a wider audience.

Beta testing is the second stage of testing and is typically done by a larger group of external testers. Beta testing is done in a real-world environment and is used to gather feedback on the product and identify any remaining issues before the final release.

Alpha and beta testing are important because they allow the development team to identify and fix any problems with the product before it is released to the general public. This helps to ensure that the product is of high quality and meets the needs of the users.
