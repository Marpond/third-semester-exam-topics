The Agile Testing Quadrant is a model for understanding the different types of testing that are typically performed during the software development process. It divides testing into four categories: automatic tests, manual tests, unit tests, and usability tests.

## Automatic Tests

Automatic tests are tests that are run by a computer without the need for human intervention. These tests can be run repeatedly and at any time, and are typically used to ensure that the software is functioning correctly.

## Manual Tests

Manual tests are tests that are performed by a human tester. These tests may be performed during the development process to ensure that the software is functioning correctly, or they may be performed after the software has been released to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the user.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are tests that are run on individual units of code (e.g., functions, methods, etc.) to ensure that they are working as intended. These tests are typically run automatically, and are an important part of the software development process as they help to identify and fix bugs early on.

## Usability Tests

Usability tests are tests that are performed to evaluate the usability of the software. These tests may involve recruiting users to perform tasks using the software and observing their behavior, or they may involve evaluating the software against a set of usability principles. The goal of usability testing is to identify any usability issues and improve the overall user experience.
