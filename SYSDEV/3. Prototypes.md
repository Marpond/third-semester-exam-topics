Prototypes are simplified versions of a product or system that are used to test and refine the design. They are commonly used in the development process to help visualize and understand the final product, as well as to gather feedback from stakeholders and end users.

## Different types of prototypes

-   **Low-fidelity prototypes**: These are rough, basic versions of the product that are used to test early concepts and ideas. They may be created using simple materials such as paper or cardboard.
-   **High-fidelity prototypes**: These are more detailed and polished versions of the product that are used to test specific features and functionality. They may be created using more advanced tools and materials, such as computer-aided design (CAD) software or 3D printing.
-   **Interactive prototypes**: These are prototypes that can be interacted with, either through a user interface or by physically manipulating the prototype. They are used to test the usability and user experience of the product.

## Pros and cons

Pros of using prototypes in the development process include the following:

-   They can help to identify and resolve problems early in the development process, saving time and resources.
-   They can be used to gather feedback and validate design decisions with stakeholders and end users.
-   They can facilitate communication and collaboration within the development team.

Cons of using prototypes include the following:

-   They may require additional time and resources to create and maintain.
-   They may not accurately reflect the final product, leading to misunderstandings or unrealistic expectations.
-   There may be a temptation to over-engineer the prototype, leading to unnecessary complexity.
