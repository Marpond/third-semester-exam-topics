There are several parameters that could be considered when choosing a development method, including the following:

1.  Size and complexity of the project: For large, complex projects, a more structured development method may be more suitable.
2.  Time constraints: If the project has tight deadlines, a more agile development method may be more appropriate.
3.  Team skills and experience: If the team has a high level of expertise and experience, a more flexible development method may be suitable.
4.  Type of project: Different development methods may be more suitable for different types of projects, such as software development, web development, or mobile app development.
5.  Budget: The budget for the project may also influence the choice of development method, as some methods may be more expensive to implement than others.
6.  Stakeholder requirements: The needs and expectations of stakeholders, such as the client or end users, should also be considered when choosing a development method.

In general, the choice of development method should be based on the specific needs and constraints of the project, as well as the skills and experience of the development team.
