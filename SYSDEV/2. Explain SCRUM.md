SCRUM is a framework for agile software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid iteration. It is based on the idea of self-organizing, cross-functional teams that work together to deliver working software in short cycles called "sprints."

## Big picture of using Scrum

The big picture of using Scrum involves dividing the project into small, achievable goals, and then regularly reassessing and adapting the project plan based on feedback from team members and stakeholders. This allows the team to quickly respond to changes and deliver value to the customer.

## Important elements in SCRUM

-   The Scrum team: This consists of a cross-functional group of people who are responsible for delivering working software.
-   The Product Owner: This is the person responsible for representing the interests of the stakeholders and prioritizing the work of the team.
-   The Scrum Master: This is the person responsible for facilitating the process and helping the team to stay on track.
-   Sprints: These are short cycles of work, typically lasting one to four weeks, in which the team delivers a working increment of the product.

#### Different meetings
**Sprint planning meeting**

-   **First 4 hours** Product owner prioritizes the items, on the product backlog they raise the team's understanding of the items, in dialogue with the team the best possible set of items are selected, then a sprint backlog is selected.
-   **Last 4 hours** The scrum team works on the sprint backlog in further detail, items are broken down into tasks (no more than 16 hrs per task), they count the resources and the hours available, then they make an initial assignment who does which task, then they make the sprint backlog public.

**Performing a sprint** The team self-organizes, splits the work. The team attends the daily scrum meetings and update estimates on the sprint backlog. They are set free to fulfill the sprint.

**Daily scrum meetings** Lasts 15 minutes, same place same time every working day. The meeting is public, but only the scrum team and master speaks. Three questions are asked to each team member: What have you done, what will you do, anything holding you back? Then the scrum master reports on their work, such as removed obstacles and implemented improvements.

**Sprint review meeting** Lasts max 4 hours (max 2 hrs for preparation), the team presents the finished functionalities, stakeholders ask questions and make comments. Product owner and stakeholders list the things missing, things they want to change or new things they want to prioritize, all of this goes to the product backlog.

**Sprint retrospective meeting** The scrum team and master reviews the sprint. They go over what went well and what could be improved. After the discussion and prioritization the items for improvement go on the product backlog as non-functional items.

##### Product backlog
The product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the vision and goals of the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog.

##### Sprint backlog
The sprint backlog is a list of tasks that the development team must complete during the sprint. It is derived from the items at the top of the product backlog, and is owned and managed by the development team.

##### Increment
The increment is the sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint and the value of the increments of all previous sprints. It is the usable, tested output of the sprint that can be demonstrated to the stakeholders.

## Pros and cons

Pros of SCRUM include the following:

-   Flexibility: SCRUM allows the team to quickly adapt to changes and deliver value to the customer.
-   Collaboration: The self-organizing nature of SCRUM promotes collaboration and teamwork.
-   Visibility: The frequent checkpoints and review sessions built into the process provide visibility into the progress of the project.

Cons of SCRUM include the following:

-   Complexity: The framework can be complex and requires a high level of discipline to implement effectively.
-   Time and resources: The frequent checkpoint meetings and review sessions required by SCRUM can be time-consuming and may require additional resources.

## Project management

Project management in SCRUM involves regularly reassessing and adjusting the project plan based on feedback from the team and stakeholders. This is done through regular review sessions, known as "sprint reviews," where the team demonstrates the working software they have delivered and discusses their progress.

## Comparison with other methods

SCRUM can be compared to other agile development methods, such as Lean and Extreme Programming (XP). Like SCRUM, these methods emphasize collaboration, flexibility, and rapid iteration. However, they differ in their specific practices and techniques. For example, Lean focuses on maximizing value and minimizing waste, while XP emphasizes technical practices such as pair programming and continuous testing.
