Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that is suited for small to medium sized teams. It emphasizes on the importance of communication, simplicity, and feedback in the development process.

## Big Picture

##### Values
XP improves a software project in four essential ways
- Simplicity
- Communication
- Feedback
- Courage

##### Principles
1. **Incremental planning: ![[Pasted image 20230107220009.png]]
2. **Small releases**: Deliver real business value on a short cycle, promotes rapid feedback. Produces a sense of accomplishment, reduces risks and makes adapting to new requirements easier.
3. **Simple design**: Just enough to meet the requirements, do the bare minimum. 
4. **Test first**: Create unit tests even before the functionality is implemented.
5. **Refactoring**: Refactor as soon as opportunity for improvement is found. Refactor on demand, not speculation. Do not overdo code, keep it simple.
6. **Pair programming**: Two programmers switch between programming and strategizing.
7. **Continuous integration**: ![[Pasted image 20230107220712.png]]
8. **On-site customer**: The customer is an actual part of the team. Sits with them, brings requirements.

## Pros and Cons

## Project Management

In XP, project management focuses on delivering working software through a series of iterative cycles called "iterations." Each iteration has a specific goal and deliverable, and the team works together to meet these goals within the allotted time.

XP also emphasizes the importance of continuous integration and testing, and encourages the use of automated testing tools to ensure the quality of the software. It also encourages the use of pair programming, where two developers work together on the same task, to facilitate collaboration and improve code quality.
