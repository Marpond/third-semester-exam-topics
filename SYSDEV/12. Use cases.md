## Use Case Diagrams

A use case diagram is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that shows the interactions between a system and its users, or "actors." It is used to represent the high-level functional requirements of a system and to identify the different types of users that will interact with the system.

## Use Cases

A use case is a description of a set of interactions between a system and one or more of its users, or "actors," in order to achieve a specific goal. A use case is typically associated with a specific actor and is represented by a stick figure on a use case diagram.

## Actors in Use Case Diagrams

An actor in a use case diagram is a representation of a user or system that interacts with the system being modeled. Actors are represented by stick figures on a use case diagram and are connected to the use cases that they are involved in by lines. Actors may be humans, other systems, or external devices that interact with the system.
