Agile and Structured development are two approaches to software development that have different philosophies and approaches to the development process.

## Agile Methods

Agile software development is a set of principles and practices that emphasize collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery. Agile methods are designed to be adaptive and responsive to change, and are based on the idea that requirements and solutions will evolve through collaboration between self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Some common agile methods include Scrum, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP).

## Structured Methods

Structured software development is a set of principles and practices that emphasize a structured, linear approach to the development process. Structured methods are based on the idea that the requirements and design of a software system can be fully specified up front, and that the development process can be planned and executed in a linear, sequential manner. One example of a structured method is the Waterfall method.

## Comparison

Agile methods and structured methods have different approaches to the software development process. Agile methods are designed to be flexible and adaptable, and are well-suited to projects with rapidly changing requirements or uncertain outcomes. Structured methods, on the other hand, are more suited to projects with well-defined requirements and a clear understanding of the end product.

There are pros and cons to both approaches. Agile methods can be more efficient and effective in certain situations, but may be more difficult to manage and control. Structured methods, on the other hand, can be more predictable and easier to manage, but may be less flexible and adaptable to change.
