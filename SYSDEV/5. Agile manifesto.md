The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development. It was first published in 2001 by a group of software developers who were seeking a better way to develop software. The manifesto consists of four core values and twelve principles.

The four values of the Agile Manifesto are:

-   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools: The Agile Manifesto emphasizes the importance of people and their interactions, rather than relying on processes and tools as the primary means of achieving results.
-   **Working software** over comprehensive documentation: The Agile Manifesto values the delivery of functional software over the creation of extensive documentation.
-   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation: The Agile Manifesto prioritizes collaboration with customers over the negotiation of contracts.
-   **Responding to change** over following a plan: The Agile Manifesto recognizes that change is inevitable, and values the ability to adapt and respond to it over sticking to a rigid plan.

## Implementation in Agile Methods

One of the most well-known Agile methods is Scrum, which is based on the Agile Manifesto. Here are a few examples of how the Agile Manifesto is implemented in Scrum:

-   **Individuals and interactions**: In Scrum, the development team is composed of self-organizing and cross-functional individuals who work together to deliver value.
-   **Working software**: In Scrum, the team delivers working software at the end of each iteration, or "sprint."
-   **Customer collaboration**: In Scrum, the customer is closely involved in the development process, providing feedback and collaborating with the team to define and prioritize requirements.
-   **Responding to change**: In Scrum, the team can adapt and respond to change by reassessing and re-prioritizing the work to be done in each sprint.

## Daily Scrum and the Agile Manifesto

The Daily Scrum is a meeting that is held daily in Scrum to review progress and plan for the next day. It is based on the Agile values of collaboration and flexibility, and helps the team to stay aligned with the goals of the project. The Daily Scrum is one way that the Agile Manifesto is implemented in Scrum, as it provides a regular opportunity for the team to review progress, identify any obstacles, and adapt to change.
