1. Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class is called the derived class, and the existing class is the base class. The derived class inherits all of the properties and methods of the base class, and can also have additional properties and methods of its own.

2. Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows you to use a single interface to refer to multiple types of objects. This is achieved through inheritance and the use of virtual methods and overriding.

3. A virtual method is a method that is marked with the `virtual` keyword and can be overridden by a derived class. 

4. An overriding method is a method in a derived class that has the same name and signature as a virtual method in the base class, but provides a new implementation of the method.
