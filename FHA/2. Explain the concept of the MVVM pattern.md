Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a design pattern that is used to separate the presentation layer of an application from the underlying logic. The goal of this pattern is to make it easier to design and develop user interfaces, and to improve the separation of concerns between the user interface and the business logic.

The MVVM pattern consists of three main components:

1.  **Model**: This represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the application's data and for performing any necessary calculations or operations on that data.

2.  **View**: This represents the user interface of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data and providing a way for the user to interact with the application.

3.  **ViewModel**: This acts as a bridge between the View and the Model. It exposes properties and commands that the View can bind to, and it translates user actions into operations on the Model. It also performs any necessary data manipulation or formatting that is required to display the data in the View.

The main benefit of the MVVM pattern is that it allows you to design the user interface of an application independently of the underlying logic. This makes it easier to create and maintain complex user interfaces, as the logic and data can be separated from the presentation layer. It also makes it easier to unit test the application, as the ViewModel can be tested without the need for a user interface.
