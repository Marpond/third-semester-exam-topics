```cs
public abstract class Bindable : INotifyPropertyChanged  
{  
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler? PropertyChanged;  
  
    public void PropertyIsChanged([CallerMemberName] string memberName = "")  
    {  
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(memberName));  
    }  
}
```

The `Bindable` class is a helper class that simplifies the process of implementing data binding in WPF using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. It provides an implementation of the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface, which is used to notify the UI when a property of a view model has changed.

To use the `Bindable` class to implement data binding in WPF, you can create a view model class that derives from the `Bindable` class. The view model class should contain properties that represent the data that you want to bind to the UI. For example:

```cs
public class MainViewModel : Bindable
{
    private string _name;
    public string Name
    {
        get => _name;
        set
        {
            _name = value;
            PropertyIsChanged();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MainViewModel` class contains a `Name` property that represents a piece of data that can be bound to the UI. The `Name` property raises the `PropertyChanged` event when its value is changed, which is required for data binding to work.

To bind the `Name` property to the UI, you can set the `DataContext` property of the view to an instance of the `MainViewModel` class, and then use the `Binding` class in XAML to bind the property to a UI element. For example:

```xml
<Window DataContext="{Binding MainViewModel}">
    <TextBox Text="{Binding Name}" />
</Window>
```

In this example, the `Window` element is set to use the `MainViewModel` class as its data context. The `TextBox` element is then bound to the `Name` property of the `MainViewModel` using the `Binding` class.

When the `Name` property of the `MainViewModel` is changed, the `PropertyChanged` event is raised and the UI element is automatically updated to reflect the new value of the `Name` property. This allows you to easily display and update data in the UI using the MVVM design pattern.
