The factory pattern is a design pattern that is used to create objects in a super class, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The factory pattern consists of a factory class and one or more product classes. The factory class contains a method that creates objects of the product classes. The product classes are the types of objects that the factory can create.

Here is an example of the factory pattern in C#:
```cs
using System;

abstract class Product
{
}

class ConcreteProductA : Product
{
}

class ConcreteProductB : Product
{
}

class Creator
{
    public static Product FactoryMethod(int type)
    {
        if (type == 1)
            return new ConcreteProductA();
        else
            return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Product product = Creator.FactoryMethod(1);
        // Use the product...
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Creator` class contains a `FactoryMethod` that creates objects of either the `ConcreteProductA` or `ConcreteProductB` class, depending on the value of the `type` parameter. The `Product` class is an abstract class that serves as the base class for the concrete product classes.

The factory pattern is useful when you want to create objects of different types based on input or configuration, but you don't want to specify the exact type of object to create until runtime. It allows you to create objects in a flexible and reusable way, and it promotes loose coupling between the client code and the objects that are created.
