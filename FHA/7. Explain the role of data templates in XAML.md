Data templates are a feature of XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) that allow you to specify the visual representation of data in a UI element. They allow you to define how data should be displayed in a flexible and reusable way, and they make it easy to customize the appearance of data in your application.

In XAML, data templates are typically used in conjunction with data binding, which allows you to bind a UI element to a data source and automatically display the data in the element. When a data template is used with data binding, the template is applied to each item in the data source, and the resulting elements are added to the UI element that is bound to the data source.

Here is an example of a data template in XAML:
```xml
<ListBox ItemsSource="{Binding Employees}">
    <ListBox.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
                <TextBlock Text="{Binding FirstName}" />
                <TextBlock Text="{Binding LastName}" />
            </StackPanel>
        </DataTemplate>
    </ListBox.ItemTemplate>
</ListBox>
```

In this example, the `ListBox` element is bound to a data source of `Employees`. The `DataTemplate` element defines the visual representation of each item in the data source. It specifies that each item should be displayed as a horizontal `StackPanel` with two `TextBlock` elements, one for the `FirstName` and one for the `LastName`.

Data templates are useful when you want to display data in a UI element in a consistent and customizable way. They allow you to define the appearance of data in a reusable manner, and they make it easy to modify the appearance of data without changing the data itself.
