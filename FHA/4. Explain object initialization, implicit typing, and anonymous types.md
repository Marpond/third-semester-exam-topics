Object initialization is a feature in C# that allows you to create and initialize an object in a single statement. It allows you to set the values of the object's properties and fields at the time the object is created, rather than having to create the object and then set its properties and fields separately.

Here is an example of object initialization in C#:
```cs
using System;

class Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Point point = new Point { X = 10, Y = 20 };
        Console.WriteLine("Point: {0}, {1}", point.X, point.Y);
    }
}
```

Implicit typing is a feature of C# that allows you to declare a variable without specifying its type. Instead, the type is inferred from the value that is assigned to the variable. This can make your code more concise and easier to read, as you don't have to specify the type of the variable explicitly.

Here is an example of implicit typing in C#:
```cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var x = 10;       // x is inferred to be of type int
        var y = "hello";  // y is inferred to be of type string
        Console.WriteLine("x is of type {0}", x.GetType());
        Console.WriteLine("y is of type {0}", y.GetType());
    }
}
```

Anonymous types are types that are automatically generated by the compiler and have no names. They are useful when you want to create an object that has a small number of properties and you don't want to create a separate class for it.

Here is an example of anonymous types in C#:
```cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var person = new { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
        Console.WriteLine("Name: {0}, Age: {1}", person.Name, person.Age);
    }
}
```
