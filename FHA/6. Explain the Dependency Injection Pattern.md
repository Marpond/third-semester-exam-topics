Dependency injection is a design pattern that is used to create loose coupling between objects. It allows an object to be constructed with its dependencies, rather than having to create them itself.

The dependency injection pattern consists of three main components:

1.  **Dependency**: This is an object that a class depends on in order to perform its tasks.
2.  **Client**: This is a class that requires a dependency in order to perform its tasks.
3.  **Injector**: This is a class that is responsible for creating and injecting the dependencies into the client.

Here is an example of dependency injection in C#:
```cs
using System;

interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

class EmailLogger : ILogger
{
    private readonly string _emailAddress;

    public EmailLogger(string emailAddress)
    {
        _emailAddress = emailAddress;
    }

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Code to send an email to the specified address...
        Console.WriteLine("Email sent to {0}: {1}", _emailAddress, message);
    }
}

class Client
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public Client(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        _logger.Log("Doing something...");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ILogger consoleLogger = new ConsoleLogger();
        Client client = new(consoleLogger);
        client.DoSomething();

        ILogger emailLogger = new EmailLogger("john@example.com");
        client = new Client(emailLogger);
        client.DoSomething();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Client` class depends on the `ILogger` interface to log messages. The `ConsoleLogger` and `emailLogger` classes are concrete implementations of this interface that log messages to the console or by sending an email, respectively. The `Client` class is constructed with an instance of `ILogger`, which is injected by the `Program` class. This allows the `Client` class to be flexible and easily extendable, as it can work with any implementation of the `ILogger` interface.

Dependency injection is useful when you want to reduce the tight coupling between classes, and when you want to make it easier to test and maintain your code. It allows you to modify the dependencies of a class without changing the class itself, and it makes it easier to manage the dependencies of complex object graphs.
