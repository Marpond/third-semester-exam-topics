#### TRAINING 
1. First you need labelled texts (supervised learning) 
2. Using all the texts, from all the classes, create a bag of words (unique words in the whole corpus of text) 
3. The bag of words will be represented as a vector, and each unique word has an index in this vector 
4. For every text, in all classes, create a vector representation of the text using the bag of words. 1s in indices where the word exist in the text, 0s if the word doesn’t exist. 
5. After the vectors have all been created, the training is complete 
6. To avoid biases, the vectors can all be normalized so they all have length = 1.

#### CLASSIFYING AN UNKNOWN TEXT 
1. To classify an unknown text, first vectorize it using the bag of words. 
2. Then calculate the distance from this vector to every other text’s vector. 
3. If using NN = 3 in this case, get the 3 closest vectors (smallest distances from the previous bullet point)
4. Find the class of the majority of the 3 closest neighbours. That is the class to which the unclassified text belongs to.
