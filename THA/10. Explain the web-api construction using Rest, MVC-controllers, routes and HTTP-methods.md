REST is an architectural style for designing APIs that focuses on the use of standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, to manipulate data.

REST APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. For example, a 200 OK status code indicates that the request was successful, while a 404 Not Found status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found.

In a REST API, a route is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that defines the location of a specific resource or group of resources. For example, in an API for a blog, you might have routes for retrieving a list of blog posts, creating a new blog post, or deleting an existing blog post.

HTTP methods, also known as verbs, are used in a REST API to specify the desired action to be performed on a specific resource. The most commonly used HTTP methods in a REST API are:

-   GET: Used to retrieve a resource or a collection of resources.
-   POST: Used to create a new resource.
-   PUT: Used to update an existing resource.
-   DELETE: Used to delete an existing resource.
