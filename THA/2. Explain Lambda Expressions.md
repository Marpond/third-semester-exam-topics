In C#, a lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function. It can be used to create a delegate or expression tree type.

A lambda expression has the following syntax:
```cs
(input parameters) => expression or statement block
```

Here's an example of a lambda expression that takes two integers as input and returns their sum:
```cs
(int x, int y) => x + y
```

If the lambda expression has multiple statements, they must be enclosed in curly braces and a return statement must be used:
```cs
(int x, int y) => {
  int z = x + y;
  return z;
}
```

Lambda expressions can be assigned to variables of delegate types or passed as arguments to methods that expect a delegate. They can also be used to create expression trees, which can be compiled and executed at a later time.

Here's an example of how you can use a lambda expression to create a delegate and invoke it:
```cs
Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
int result = add(2, 3);
```

Lambda expressions are useful for writing concise and expressive code, especially when working with LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and other functional programming concepts in C#. They can make your code easier to read and maintain by eliminating the need to create separate methods for simple operations.
