SOLID is an acronym that stands for five principles of object-oriented design:

1.  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
2.  Open/Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3.  Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4.  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5.  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather, both should depend on abstractions.

Here are some examples of how these principles can be applied in C#:

1.  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
```cs
public class UserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;

    public UserService(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public void RegisterUser(User user)
    {
        // Validate user input
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(user.Username))
        {
            throw new Exception("Username is required");
        }

        // Save user to repository
        _userRepository.Add(user);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `UserService` class has a single responsibility: to register a user. It has two methods for this purpose: one for validating the user input and one for saving the user to the repository. By following the SRP, we have separated the validation logic from the persistence logic, which makes the class easier to maintain and test.

2.  Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
```cs
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double Area();
}

public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

public class ShapeCalculator
{
    public double CalculateTotalArea(IEnumerable<Shape> shapes)
    {
        double totalArea = 0;
        foreach (var shape in shapes)
        {
            totalArea += shape.Area();
        }
        return totalArea;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class is open for extension but closed for modification. We can extend the `Shape` class by creating new subclasses, such as `Rectangle` and `Circle`, that override the `Area` method. However, we cannot modify the `Shape` class itself, as it is marked as abstract.

The `ShapeCalculator` class is also open for extension, as it can calculate the total area of any type of `Shape` without needing to modify its code.

3.  Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
```cs
public abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract string MakeSound();
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override string MakeSound()
    {
        return "Bark";
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override string MakeSound()
    {
        return "Meow";
    }
}

public class AnimalTrainer
{
    public void Train(Animal animal)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(animal.MakeSound());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `AnimalTrainer` class can train any type of `Animal`, as long as it conforms to the `Animal` interface. This means that we can substitute a `Dog` or a `Cat` for an `Animal` and the `Train` method will still work correctly, because both classes override the `MakeSound` method and return a string value.

The Liskov Substitution Principle helps to ensure that subtypes are interchangeable with their base types, which makes the code more flexible and reusable.

4.  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
```cs
public interface IShape
{
    double Area();
}

public interface ICircle : IShape
{
    double Radius { get; set; }
}

public interface IRectangle : IShape
{
    double Width { get; set; }
    double Height { get; set; }
}

public class Circle : ICircle
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle : IRectangle
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public double Area()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}
```

In the given code example, the `IShape` interface defines a single method for calculating the area of a shape. The `ICircle` and `IRectangle` interfaces inherit from the `IShape` interface and define additional properties that are specific to circles and rectangles.

By following the ISP, we have ensured that clients that depend on the `ICircle` and `IRectangle` interfaces only have to implement the methods and properties that they need, rather than being forced to depend on a large and complex interface with many unnecessary methods and properties.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
```cs
public interface IUserRepository
{
    void Add(User user);
}

public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    public void Add(User user)
    {
        // Save user to database
    }
}

public class UserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;

    public UserService(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public void RegisterUser(User user)
    {
        // Validate user input
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(user.Username))
        {
            throw new Exception("Username is required");
        }

        // Save user to repository
        _userRepository.Add(user);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `UserService` class depends on the `IUserRepository` interface, which defines a single method for adding a user to the repository. This means that the `UserService` class is not directly dependent on a specific implementation of the repository, such as a database or a file.

By following the DIP, we have ensured that the `UserService` class is decoupled from the `UserRepository` class, and that both classes depend on the `IUserRepository` interface. This makes it easier to change the implementation of the repository without affecting the `UserService` class, and vice versa.
