The builder pattern is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows you to create objects in a step-by-step manner, using a separate builder object to control the process.

In the builder pattern, you define a builder interface that specifies the methods for creating the different parts of the object. Then, you create concrete builder classes that implement the builder interface and define the steps for constructing the object. Finally, you create a director class that uses the builder to create the object.

Here's an example of how you can use the builder pattern in C# to build a car object:
```cs
public interface ICarBuilder
{
    void SetWheels();
    void SetEngine();
    void SetBody();
    Car GetCar();
}

public class Car
{
    public int Wheels { get; set; }
    public string Engine { get; set; }
    public string Body { get; set; }
}

public class CarBuilder : ICarBuilder
{
    private Car _car = new Car();

    public void SetWheels()
    {
        _car.Wheels = 4;
    }

    public void SetEngine()
    {
        _car.Engine = "V6";
    }

    public void SetBody()
    {
        _car.Body = "Sedan";
    }

    public Car GetCar()
    {
        return _car;
    }
}

public class CarDirector
{
    private readonly ICarBuilder _carBuilder;

    public CarDirector(ICarBuilder carBuilder)
    {
        _carBuilder = carBuilder;
    }

    public void BuildCar()
    {
        _carBuilder.SetWheels();
        _carBuilder.SetEngine();
        _carBuilder.SetBody();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ICarBuilder` interface defines the methods for creating the different parts of a `Car` object. The `CarBuilder` class is a concrete implementation of the `ICarBuilder` interface that defines the steps for constructing a `Car` object. The `CarDirector` class is a director that uses the `CarBuilder` to create a `Car` object by calling the appropriate methods in a specific order.

The builder pattern is useful when you want to create complex objects that have a lot of parts or when the construction process involves multiple steps. It allows you to create objects in a flexible and customizable way, without exposing the details of the construction process to the client.

Here's an example of how you can use the code from the builder pattern example to create a car object:
```cs
ICarBuilder carBuilder = new CarBuilder();
CarDirector carDirector = new CarDirector(carBuilder);
carDirector.BuildCar();
Car car = carBuilder.GetCar();

Console.WriteLine("Wheels: " + car.Wheels);  // Output: Wheels: 4
Console.WriteLine("Engine: " + car.Engine);  // Output: Engine: V6
Console.WriteLine("Body: " + car.Body);  // Output: Body: Sedan
```
