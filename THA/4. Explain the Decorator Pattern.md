The decorator pattern is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that allows you to add new behavior to existing objects dynamically. It is an alternative to subclassing, which involves creating a new subclass for each new variation of an object.

In the decorator pattern, you create a wrapper class that "decorates" the original object by adding new functionality to it. The wrapper class has the same interface as the original object and contains a reference to the original object. When a method is called on the wrapper, it can either perform its own behavior or delegate the call to the original object.

Here's an example of how you can use the decorator pattern in C# to add logging functionality to a class:
```cs
public interface IComponent
{
    void Operation();
}

public class Component : IComponent
{
    public void Operation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Operation called on component");
    }
}

public class Decorator : IComponent
{
    private readonly IComponent _component;

    public Decorator(IComponent component)
    {
        _component = component;
    }

    public void Operation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Logging before operation");
        _component.Operation();
        Console.WriteLine("Logging after operation");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Component` class is the original object that has a single `Operation` method. The `Decorator` class is the wrapper that decorates the `Component` object by adding logging functionality to it. It has the same interface as the `Component` class and contains a reference to an instance of the `Component` class. When the `Operation` method is called on the `Decorator`, it logs a message before and after calling the `Operation` method on the `Component`.

Usage of the given code:
```cs
IComponent component = new Component();
IComponent decoratedComponent = new Decorator(component);

decoratedComponent.Operation();
```

The decorator pattern is useful when you want to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its code. It allows you to create a flexible and extensible design by adding new behavior to an object dynamically at runtime.
