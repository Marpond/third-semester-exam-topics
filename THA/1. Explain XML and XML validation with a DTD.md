XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that is used to encode documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is a text-based language that uses tags to define the structure and content of a document. XML is designed to be flexible and extensible, which means that it can be used to encode a wide range of document types and data structures.

One way to ensure that an XML document conforms to a specific set of rules is to use a Document Type Definition (DTD). A DTD is a set of rules that specifies the structure and content of an XML document. It defines the elements that can be used in the document, as well as the attributes that can be applied to those elements and the relationships between them.

To validate an XML document using a DTD, you need to specify the DTD in the document itself or reference it from an external file. Then, you can use an XML parser to validate the document against the DTD. If the document is found to be invalid, the parser will return an error message indicating where the problem lies in the document.

Here is an example of an XML document with a DTD:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "note.dtd">
<note>
  <to>John</to>
  <from>Jane</from>
  <subject>Hello</subject>
  <body>Hello, how are you?</body>
</note>
```

And here is the corresponding DTD file (note.dtd):
```dtd
<!ELEMENT note (to,from,subject,body)>
<!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT subject (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
```

The DTD in this example defines a `note` element that must contain `to`, `from`, `subject`, and `body` elements. It also specifies that these elements can contain only character data (PCDATA).

Validation with a DTD is one way to ensure that an XML document is well-formed and follows a specific set of rules. However, it has some limitations and is not as powerful as other methods of validation, such as using an XML schema.
