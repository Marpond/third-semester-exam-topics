White box testing, also known as structural testing or glass box testing, is a method of testing the internal structure and design of a software system or application. The focus of white box testing is on the program's code, including the functions, methods, and algorithms used. It is used to validate that the internal logic and flow of the code is working as intended, and to ensure that all code paths have been exercised and that there are no errors or bugs.

During white box testing, the tester looks at the code and design of the software, and creates test cases based on that knowledge. The goal is to test all possible code paths, ensuring that all functions, methods and algorithms are working correctly. This type of testing typically requires a thorough understanding of the programming languages and frameworks used to develop the software.

Here's an example of how white box testing can be performed in C#:

```cs
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

[TestMethod]
public void Add_PositiveNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    // Act
    int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
}

[TestMethod]
public void Add_NegativeNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    // Act
    int result = calculator.Add(-2, -3);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(-5, result);
}

[TestMethod]
public void Add_PositiveAndNegativeNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    // Act
    int result = calculator.Add(2, -3);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(-1, result);
}
```

In this example, we have defined a simple `Calculator` class with an `Add` method that takes two integers and returns their sum. We have also defined three test methods that use the `Calculator` class to test the `Add` method with different input values.
