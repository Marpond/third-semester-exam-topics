White box testing, also known as structural testing or glass box testing, is a software testing technique that involves testing the internal structure of a program or system. In white box testing, the tester has access to the source code and can test the program at a low level, by examining the individual components and their interactions.

Here's an example of how white box testing can be performed in C#:

```cs
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

[TestMethod]
public void Add_PositiveNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    // Act
    int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
}

[TestMethod]
public void Add_NegativeNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    // Act
    int result = calculator.Add(-2, -3);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(-5, result);
}

[TestMethod]
public void Add_PositiveAndNegativeNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    // Act
    int result = calculator.Add(2, -3);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(-1, result);
}
```

In this example, we have defined a simple `Calculator` class with an `Add` method that takes two integers and returns their sum. We have also defined three test methods that use the `Calculator` class to test the `Add` method with different input values.
