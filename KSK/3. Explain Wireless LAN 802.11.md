A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a type of local area network (LAN) that uses wireless communication to connect devices. Instead of using cables to connect devices to a network, WLANs use radio waves or infrared signals to transmit and receive data. This allows devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets to connect to the network without being physically connected to it.

IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards for wireless local area networks (WLANs). It defines the physical and MAC (Media Access Control) layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which are responsible for transmitting data over a wireless communication channel.

| 802.11a  | Operates in the 5 GHz frequency band and supports data rates up to 54 Mbps. Designed to be used in high-density environments and is less prone to interference from other devices operating in the 2.4 GHz band.                                                                                |
| 802.11b  | Operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and supports data rates up to 11 Mbps. The first widely adopted version of 802.11, it has a relatively low cost and is popular for home and small business use. However, it is more prone to interference from other devices operating in the same band. |
| 802.11g  | Operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and supports data rates up to 54 Mbps. Provides backward compatibility with 802.11b devices and is widely used in home and small business networks.                                                                                                      |
| 802.11n  | Operates in both the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequency bands and supports data rates up to 600 Mbps. Uses multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology to improve range and signal strength.                                                                                                          |
| 802.11ac | Operates in the 5 GHz frequency band and supports data rates up to 6.9 Gbps. Uses MIMO technology and wider channels to improve performance.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 802.11ax | Operates in both the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequency bands and supports data rates up to 10 Gbps. Uses MIMO and other technologies to improve performance in high-density environments and support more devices on a single network.                                                                    |

All versions of the 802.11 standard use a technique called CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) to transmit data over the wireless communication channel. This technique allows multiple devices to transmit data over the same channel by sensing the channel's availability and adjusting their transmission patterns accordingly.
