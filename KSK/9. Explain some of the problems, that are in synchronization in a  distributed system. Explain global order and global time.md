Synchronization is a key issue in distributed systems, as it involves coordinating the actions of multiple devices that may be geographically distributed and connected via a network. Some of the problems that can occur in synchronization in a distributed system include:

-   Clock drift: Distributed systems often rely on clocks to synchronize the actions of devices, but clocks can drift over time due to differences in the rate at which they tick. This can cause devices to have different notions of what time it is, which can lead to problems in synchronization.

-   Network latency: Network latency, or the delay in transmitting data over a network, can also cause problems in synchronization. For example, if one device sends a message to another device and the message takes a long time to be delivered, the receiving device may have moved on to other tasks by the time the message arrives, leading to synchronization problems.

-   Message loss: In some cases, messages may be lost or delayed due to network issues, such as congestion or packet loss. This can also cause synchronization problems, as devices may be waiting for messages that never arrive or may receive messages out of order.

Global order is a concept in distributed systems that refers to the order in which events occur across the system. In order to ensure that events are processed in the correct order, it is often necessary to establish a global order that is consistent across all devices in the system.

Global time is a related concept that refers to the notion of a single, global clock that is used to synchronize the actions of devices in a distributed system. Global time is often implemented using a distributed clock synchronization protocol, which is used to synchronize the clocks of devices in the system and ensure that they all have a consistent view of what time it is.
