The ISO-OSI (International Organization for Standardization Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework for understanding how communication occurs between different devices on a network. It is a seven-layer model that defines the different functions that need to be performed in order to transmit data between devices.

Each layer in the ISO-OSI model is responsible for performing a specific set of functions, and each layer communicates with the layer above and below it using a specific set of protocols. The layers are organized as follows:

1.  **Physical layer**: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw data over a communication channel. It defines the physical characteristics of the communication channel, such as the type of cables or wireless frequencies that are used.

2.  **Data link layer**: This layer is responsible for providing reliable data transmission between two devices that are connected directly by a communication channel. It defines how data is packaged into frames and how frames are transmitted over the communication channel.

3.  **Network layer**: This layer is responsible for routing data packets between devices on a network. It defines how data is addressed and how it is forwarded through the network.

4.  **Transport layer**: This layer is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order to its destination. It defines how data is segmented into smaller units and how these units are reassembled at the destination.

5.  **Session layer**: This layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions between devices. It defines how devices can request and release resources, such as connections or buffers.

6.  **Presentation layer**: This layer is responsible for translating data between different formats and encoding schemes. It defines how data is transformed into a common format that can be understood by both the sender and the receiver.

7.  **Application layer**: This layer is responsible for providing the interface between the network and the applications that use the network. It defines how applications can request and exchange data with other devices on the network.

Here is a summary of the ISO-OSI model and its layers:

| Layer | Description  |
|-------|--------------|
| 7     | Application  |
| 6     | Presentation |
| 5     | Session      |
| 4     | Transport    |
| 3     | Network      |
| 2     | Data link    |
| 1     | Physical     |

Each layer in the ISO-OSI model has a specific set of protocols that it uses to communicate with the layer above and below it. For example, the Physical layer uses protocols such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi to transmit data over a physical communication channel, while the Data link layer uses protocols such as MAC (Media Access Control) to package data into frames and transmit them over the communication channel.

The ISO-OSI model is a useful framework for understanding how communication occurs between different devices on a network, and it is widely used in the field of computer networking.
