The ISO-OSI (International Organization for Standardization Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework for understanding how communication occurs between different devices on a network. It is a seven-layer model that defines the different functions that need to be performed in order to transmit data between devices.

Each layer in the ISO-OSI model is responsible for performing a specific set of functions, and each layer communicates with the layer above and below it using a specific set of protocols. The layers are organized as follows:

1.   Physical layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw bits over a communication channel. The physical layer uses a variety of protocols, including RS-232, USB, and Ethernet, to control the electrical and mechanical interfaces between devices.

2.  Data Link layer: This layer is responsible for providing reliable transit of data across a physical link. The data link layer uses protocols such as Ethernet, PPP, and Frame Relay to create a reliable link between two devices on a network.

3.  Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing packets through an internetwork. The network layer uses protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol), IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange), and AppleTalk to provide logical addressing and routing functionality.

4.  Transport layer: This layer is responsible for providing transparent transfer of data between systems. The transport layer uses protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to provide reliable, orderly delivery of data.

5.  Session layer: This layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications. Protocols that operate at this layer include RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and SQL (Structured Query Language)

6.  Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for providing a common format for data being exchanged between systems, as well as for performing any necessary data compression or encryption. The presentation layer use protocols like MIME,JPEG, MP3 etc

7.  Application layer: This layer is responsible for providing a user interface and support for services such as email, file transfer, and network management. The application layer use protocols like HTTP, SMTP, FTP, SSH, and Telnet.

Here is a summary of the ISO-OSI model and its layers:

| Layer | Description  |
|-------|--------------|
| 7     | Application  |
| 6     | Presentation |
| 5     | Session      |
| 4     | Transport    |
| 3     | Network      |
| 2     | Data link    |
| 1     | Physical     |

Each layer in the ISO-OSI model has a specific set of protocols that it uses to communicate with the layer above and below it. For example, the Physical layer uses protocols such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi to transmit data over a physical communication channel, while the Data link layer uses protocols such as MAC (Media Access Control) to package data into frames and transmit them over the communication channel.

The ISO-OSI model is a useful framework for understanding how communication occurs between different devices on a network, and it is widely used in the field of computer networking.
