1.  **Class A**: Class A addresses are used for large networks and have a range of 0.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0. The first octet is used to identify the network, and the remaining three octets are used to identify the host on the network.

2.  **Class B**: Class B addresses are used for medium-sized networks and have a range of 128.0.0.0 to 191.0.0.0. The first two octets are used to identify the network, and the remaining two octets are used to identify the host on the network.

3.  **Class C**: Class C addresses are used for small networks and have a range of 192.0.0.0 to 223.0.0.0. The first three octets are used to identify the network, and the last octet is used to identify the host on the network.

Here is a summary of the different classes of IP addresses and their ranges:

| Class | Range                  |
|-------|------------------------|
| A     | 0.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0   |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 to 191.0.0.0 |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 to 223.0.0.0 |

Each class of IP addresses has a different number of bits that are used to identify the network and the host. For example, Class A addresses use 8 bits for the network identifier and 24 bits for the host identifier, while Class B addresses use 16 bits for the network identifier and 16 bits for the host identifier.

The class of an IP address is determined by the value of the first octet. For example, an IP address with a first octet between 0 and 126 is a Class A address, while an IP address with a first octet between 128 and 191 is a Class B address.
