Private IP addresses are IP addresses that are not globally unique and are used for internal networks. They are defined in the following ranges:

-   10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
-   172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
-   192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Private IP addresses are not routable over the Internet and are typically used for devices on a local network, such as a home or office network.

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a networking technique that allows devices on a local network to communicate with the Internet using a single, shared public IP address. NAT is typically used in scenarios where the number of available public IP addresses is limited, and it allows devices on the local network to share the available public IP addresses to access the Internet.

NAT works by maintaining a table of mappings between the private IP addresses of devices on the local network and the shared public IP address. When a device on the local network sends a request to access the Internet, NAT translates the private IP address of the device into the shared public IP address and sends the request over the Internet. When a response is received, NAT translates the public IP address back into the private IP address of the device and sends the response to the device.
