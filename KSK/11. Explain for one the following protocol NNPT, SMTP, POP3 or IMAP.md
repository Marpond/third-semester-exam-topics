SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for sending email messages between servers. Most email systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another, and to deliver messages to local mail clients like Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail.

SMTP is a text-based protocol that uses a series of commands and responses to transmit messages. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it is widely supported by email servers and clients.

Here is a summary of how SMTP works:

1.  A sender composes an email message using a local mail client and specifies the recipient's email address.
2.  The local mail client connects to the sender's email server and sends the message to the server using SMTP.
3.  The email server looks up the domain name of the recipient's email address and connects to the recipient's email server using SMTP.
4.  The recipient's email server receives the message and stores it in the recipient's mailbox.
5.  The recipient can then retrieve the message using a local mail client or a web-based email service.
