An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: it identifies the host or network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network.

IP addresses are usually written in dotted-decimal notation, with four numbers separated by periods. Each number is called an octet and can be a value between 0 and 255. For example, the IP address 192.168.1.1 represents four octets with the values 192, 168, 1, and 1.

IP addresses are structured according to a hierarchy of classes, in addition to the three classes, there are also several special IP addresses that have specific meanings:

-   0.0.0.0: This address is used to represent the default route, which is the route that a device uses when it does not know the specific route to a destination.

-   127.0.0.1: This address is used to represent the localhost, which is the device that the device is running on.

-   255.255.255.255: This address is used to broadcast messages to all devices on the local network.
