The Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized system that is used to translate human-readable domain names, such as example.com, into numerical IP addresses. DNS is based on a hierarchy of servers, with each server responsible for a specific portion of the domain name space.

When a device sends a request to access a website or other online resource, it first sends a request to a local DNS server. The DNS server checks its records to see if it has the IP address for the requested domain name. If it does, it sends the IP address back to the device. If it does not, it sends the request to another DNS server higher up in the hierarchy. This process continues until the IP address is found or it is determined that the domain name does not exist.

DNS is a critical component of the Internet and plays a vital role in allowing devices to access online resources. It simplifies the process of accessing online resources by allowing users to type in human-readable.
